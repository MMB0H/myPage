            <h1>About me</h1>
            <p>
              I was born on August 16, 2018 in a large family of 5 kittens. It
              was in Russia, the city of St. Petersburg. I had fun with my
              brothers and sisters. We played, I explored the world. But when
              some bipeds came, I hid. I was afraid of these big people. They
              came to the human mother and took my brothers and sisters. And one
              day they took me too. I moved into a large apartment with two
              people. In the first days I was afraid of everything and settled
              in the bathroom. I was 3 months old, I was already eating pate and
              going to the litter box myself. After a couple of days I got used
              to it and found out how big my apartment was now. I studied
              everything, ran and played. I felt good. that's how I grew up. I
              was loved. after a couple of years, I was given to some other
              people for a couple of months. but I don’t understand why. Then
              they came back for me and I immediately made the trip on the
              plane. I was scared, but I bravely endured this day. Now I live in
              a spacious apartment in Israel. I feel good here, even though it’s
              hot. I have a balcony and sometimes I chase birds there.

              I don't remember my childhood. I remember that they loved me. at
              some point in time, I found myself on the street. I was about 7
              months old. one day I walked among the bushes. I didn't know where
              to go. I was hungry and lonely. people passed by, called me and
              left. suddenly a girl came, fed me, picked me up, put me in the
              car and drove away. later, it turned out to be my current human
              mother. I now live in a large apartment with a balcony. I am loved
              and fed. There is another cat in the apartment, people call him
              Pixel. sometimes we play. I feel good here, even though the
              weather is hot, and I have a thick coat.
